          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm <strong>Janelle Kaye Borabo</strong> â€” a web development enthusiast from Lucena City with a love for crafting smart and user-centered digital experiences.
            I'm currently studying at <strong>Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena</strong>, sharpening my skills and exploring the art of building on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first discovered my passion for tech at <strong>Systems Technology Institute</strong> and have been hooked ever since. 
            I'm always excited to learn, improve, and dive into new challenges as I grow in this fast-paced industry.
          </p>
